# Private Notes

A simple SwiftUI (with CoreData) app to handle notes taking with CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) functios.

## Notes
* Due to the limitation of device, this app can only be tested on iOS 16.6 on a device,
* In 'NoteListView', If the list of notes is not showing, please make sure you have created at least one note and try to click the 'Refresh' button, this is a navigation issue I am yet to fix. 
* In the 'NoteDetailsView' there seams to be an issue with TextField from SwiftUI where the keyboard is getting hidden automatically, this could run OK on a device running iOS 17.0+.

## How to run 

Download the codes and double click the project file inside 'PrivateNotes' foler, then make sure the deployment target is iOS 16.6 or higher and you can run on device or simulator.
